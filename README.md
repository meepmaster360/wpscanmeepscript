Wpscan script


Here's a Bash script that uses WPScan to perform user enumeration and then conducts a brute force attack using a specified password list:

Replace "http://example.com" with the URL of your target WordPress site, and /path/to/passwordlist.txt with the path to your password list file.

This script first performs user enumeration using WPScan, extracts the list of usernames from the enumeration result, and then conducts a brute force attack for each username using the specified password list.

Please make sure you have permission from the site owner before running this script against any WordPress site. Unauthorized access attempts can have legal consequences. Use this script responsibly and only on systems where you have explicit permission to do so.
